## CSE 373 - P2

A set of programs implementing map variants - chainedHashMaps and arrayMaps with defined methods and constraints

# Implementation

-All methods must run in O(n) time, where n is the size of the map.
-size() and iterator() must run in O(1) time.
-The iterator() function must return an iterator that adheres to all the requirements listed in the Iterator section.
-It is not required to downsize your array if the user removes many elements.
-Internal array stores elements of type SimpleEntry<K, V>
